A secure and intelligent transportation management platform developed for VET Institute of Arts and Science.
The system modernizes traditional bus attendance systems by integrating dynamic QR authentication, GPS tracking, device binding security, and geofenced attendance verification.

It ensures:

Student safety

Operational transparency

Real-time monitoring

Proxy-proof attendance

🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The goal of this system is to digitize and automate student bus attendance and transport monitoring in educational institutions.

Traditional bus attendance systems rely on manual registers or driver memory, which leads to:

Human errors

Proxy attendance

Lack of real-time monitoring

Poor accountability

The VETIAS Bus Management System solves these issues by combining QR authentication, GPS validation, and device-level security, ensuring accurate and secure transport management.

🔒 SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE

The system implements a multi-layered security architecture to ensure reliable and tamper-proof attendance.

1️⃣ Device Fingerprinting

Each student account is bound to a specific device, preventing credential sharing.

2️⃣ GPS Geofencing

Attendance can only be marked if the student's device is within 100 meters of the bus location.

3️⃣ Secure Session Management

Administrative actions use protected server-side sessions to prevent unauthorized access.

4️⃣ Encrypted Credentials

User passwords are securely stored using SHA-256 hashing.
